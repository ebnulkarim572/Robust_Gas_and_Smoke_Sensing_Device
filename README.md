# Robust_Gas_and_Smoke_Sensing_Device
A hardware and software based prototype we called “Robust Gas and Smoke Sensing Device” (An open source project) made of combining “MQ-2 Gas Sensor Module”, “I2C Liquid Crystal Display”, “Arduino Uno Board” and “Arduino IDE Software”. It is suitable for sensing gaseous ecology of LPG, Smoke, Alcohol, Butane, Propane, Hydrogen, Methane and Carbon Monoxide concentrations anywhere in the air. When measuring gases like Carbon Monoxide, LPG, or methane, the term concentration is used to describe the amount of gas by volume in the air. In this prototype we used Parts-per-million (abbreviated ppm) is the ratio of one gas to another. For example, 1000ppm of CO means that if you could count a million gas molecules, 1000 of them would be of carbon monoxide and 999,000 molecules would be some other gases. By this prototype gaseous concentrations values (PPM) can be observed in our planet or other planets regarding “NASA’S Terra Satellite data” which collect data by the MOPITT (Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere) sensor, “NASA Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) data” instrument which measures levels of carbon monoxide at an altitude of 18,000 feet. Here suitable standard gas sensing index for “MQ-2 Gas sensor” is (300-10000) PPM. Our prototype is capable of real time computerized GPRS messaging alert system through SIM900A Kit Module when it detects gases or smokes according to MQ-2 Gas sensor.This prototype is planned for creating an indoor air quality monitoring system, breath checker, explore presence of gases (LPG, Alcohol, Propane, Hydrogen, Methane and Carbon Monoxide) or early fire detection system. So, this Prototype is not only suitable for exploring presence of gases but also to detect gas leakage get the necessary gaseous ecological information to response to the upcoming danger (i.e. Rainforest wildfires smoke detection, Domestic gas leakage detection, Industrial Combustible gas detection, gas detection in different types of mining cave, detecting unsuitable gaseous environmental places or planets). Here all types of detection is real time detection through the prototype, but the normal and danger gaseous concentration index value may change according to the gaseous ecology of the place or planet. Finally, these data will help us to compare the current situation of the surrounding gaseous environment and find any imbalance or unusual activity of the environment. So that we can find information about real time upcoming danger on that specific location. And also help us to predict the initial impacts of those danger to inhabitants, real life and property &amp; helps to get ready for preventive steps. These whole process of prototype will be completed based on various gaseous ecological data source, “NASA’S Terra Satellite data” and “NASA Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) data”. Moreover we will get the necessary gaseous ecological information to take precautions to the danger. We are confident that our prototype (ROBUST GAS AND SMOKE SENSING DEVICE) will impact a revolutionary change in preventing upcoming danger by predicting about various gaseous information in the air.
